# motion-proxy
Proxy service for ip cameras &amp; linux motion - lets camera do motion detection
while linux-motion encodes frames into video and performs other associated tasks.

For use with IP cameras that can detect motion on their own.

In progress - basic functionality is implemented, need to
add configuration elements, etc.
